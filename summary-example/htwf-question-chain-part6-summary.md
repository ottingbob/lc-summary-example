#### What is the impact of praise on people's behavior and performance?

 Praise has been shown to reinforce good behavior and performance, while minimizing criticism. It can be a powerful tool for motivating people and improving their performance.

##### In Summary
> The basic concept of B.F. Skinner's teachings is to use praise instead of criticism. Skinner's experiments with animals and humans have shown that when criticism is minimized and praise is emphasized, people's good behaviors are reinforced and their negative behaviors diminish. This approach was successfully applied by John Ringelspaugh in dealing with his children, who were becoming worse after being yelled at by their parents. The importance of genuine appreciation and recognition is highlighted, as opposed to insincere flattery. The principles taught in this book aim to promote positive reinforcement and effective communication.
