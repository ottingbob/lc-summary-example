#### How does criticism negatively impact relationships?

 Criticism can demoralize employees, family members, and friends, and can create resentment that can damage relationships.

##### In Summary
> The basic concept of B.F. Skinner's teachings is to use praise instead of criticism. Skinner's experiments with animals and humans have shown that when criticism is minimized and praise is emphasized, good behavior is reinforced and poor behavior diminishes. This principle was applied by John Ringelspaugh in dealing with his children, who were often yelled at by their parents. By beginning with praise and honest appreciation, Ringelspaugh was able to improve the behavior of his children. Similarly, Charles Schwab used a non-confrontational approach when he found employees smoking in a no-smoking area. Instead of reprimanding them, he handed each employee a cigar and asked them to smoke it outside. This approach made the employees feel important and admired Schwab for his understanding. The principle of self-criticism is also discussed, suggesting that it is better to acknowledge one's own mistakes before others have a chance to criticize. This can lead to a more forgiving attitude and minimize the impact of one's mistakes. The importance of giving honest and sincere appreciation is emphasized, as it can have a lasting impact on individuals. B.F. Skinner's experiments have shown that rewarding good behavior is more effective than punishing bad behavior, and this applies to humans as well. Criticism can lead to resentment and demoralization without effectively correcting the situation. Overall, the use of praise instead of criticism is advocated for improving behavior and relationships.

#### Why is it important to focus on what others want and need?

 It is important to focus on what others want and need because it is the only solid foundation for interpersonal relationships. Understanding the other person's viewpoint and making them feel important will help build strong relationships and bring happiness.

##### In Summary
> The law of human conduct is to always make the other person feel important, as the desire to be important is a deep urge in human nature. This craving for importance differentiates us from animals and has been responsible for civilization. Sigmund Freud stated that everything we do stems from the sex urge and the desire to be great. John Dewey believed that the deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important. People have a few basic wants, including health, food, sleep, money, life in the hereafter, sexual gratification, the well-being of our children, and a feeling of importance. A successful way to interact with others is to have a sympathetic understanding of their viewpoint.
